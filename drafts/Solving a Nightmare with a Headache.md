# Solving a Nightmare with a Headache
**Issue**: The widgets in Jupyter Notebook were not all displaying. 

**Non-solution**: Try re-do some installs in the virtualenv. While I am at it, let's also try out pyenv.

**New Issue**: Windows does not play well with pyenv. You can get pyenv to work, but then virtualenv is no longer set up on your global environment.

**Attempted Solution**: Try to clone the pyenv-virtualenv repo into a new plugins directory of the pyenv root folder. This did not work, despite sinking about an hour into this whole mess.

**New Issue**: It's time to put Linux on my machine to try and escape some of these Windows nightmares. This is going to be a headache, but it seems like the pay off will be worth-while, given that the Fastbook also doesn't play well with Windows. Luckily, I have done this before. I just lost my work because my old mobo died, so I built a new machine last year and ended up clearing that Linux partition while moving thing around.
